Things to add:

### Testing (unit and integration)

### Implement better backend error handling

### Also figure out is it really a good idea to send back messages from api routes?

### Allow users to add specific categories such as (food, savings, housing) which have their own transactions list.

### Add ability to sort transactions by date (default), low and high.

### Refactor notification component. We want the component to hide on route changes or to disappear after x amount of time.
