Things to add:

### Testing

### Implement better backend error handling

### Allow users to add specific categories such as (food, savings, housing) which have their own transactions list.

### Add ability to sort transactions by date (default), low and high.

### Refactor notification code. We're setting state during a render which is bad. Hide/show instead of setTimeout.
